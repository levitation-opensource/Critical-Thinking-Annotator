# Critical Thinking Annotator

## Introduction

Fallacy and cognitive bias detector identifies and highlights reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases in text from human conversations and AI-generated responses. It promotes rational reasoning and clarity of mind. It mitigates harmful judgement and spreading of misinformation by detecting fallacies and biases in communication and thoughts.

In the human realm of reasoning and communication, reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases can significantly impact interpersonal relationships, business negotiations, politics, and many other areas of life.

It is against this backdrop that this new software, "Critical Thinking Annotator" comes into the picture. In contrast to various existing fact-checking software the current software focuses on the reasoning style detection and labelling.


## Functionality

Critical Thinking Annotator is a software library that allows users to analyse transcripts of conversations or individual messages. The software then analyses the text, applying labels that indicate potential reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases.

This tool offers two main use cases:

1. Large Language Model Evaluation: As more sophisticated models continue to emerge, the need for tools to measure their alignment with human values grows concurrently. Critical Thinking Annotator enables developers and researchers to evaluate and benchmark language model outputs for reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases. This can help inform adjustments and improvements to these models, promoting transparency, safety, and ethical considerations in AI development.

2. Human Communication Analysis: The application of Critical Thinking Annotator extends beyond AI. By analysing human-to-human conversations, MER can help identify reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases.

In the future, the plan is to expand Critical Thinking Annotatorâ€™s reach by offering it as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. Users will be able to access its functionalities via a web-based JSON API and a user-friendly graphical interface.

The vision for Critical Thinking Annotator is to foster a culture of reasoning that is more rational, and free from fallacies and biases. We believe that by illuminating the nuances of thought and language, we can contribute to a better understanding between humans, as well as between large language models and humans.

## Use cases

* Benchmarking of new LLM models:
    * Benchmarking LLM resistance to reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases from users. Even if the user input contains reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases, the LLM output should not contain reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases.
    * Benchmarking LLM outputs for presence of reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases in case of benign user inputs.
* Supporting humans both in their reasoning and communication with other humans as well as with LLM-s.
* Evaluation of news articles and blog posts.
* For software providers: Automatic detection of some types of prompt injections from end users.


## How it works

* This software is able to detect a detailed list of reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases.
* The locations where a particular reasoning fallacy and cognitive bias is detected are highlighted / annotated with location markers.
* Same location may also get annotated with multiple markers if appropriate.
* The software provides three main outputs:
    * Annotation of the input conversation with labels. This is for mixed qualitative/quantitative analysis purposes.
    * Summary metrics for quantitative benchmark purposes. Summary metrics contains the total counts of occurrence of each reasoning fallacy and cognitive bias per conversation participant.
    * For purely qualitative analysis, a general descriptive summary text of the involved conversation participants.
* Internally, the software uses two prompts: 
    * One prompt is closed-ended, where the current software or end user provides a concrete list of reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases. The software asks the LLM to label the conversation using the labels in this list. The objective of the closed-ended prompt is to remind LLM of many types of reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases it might otherwise forget to detect.
    * The other prompt is open-ended, where LLM can describe the reasoning styles present in input conversation in an unrestricted way and without hints from the software or user. The purpose of open-ended prompt is to extend the labels list that goes into the closed-ended prompt.
* Some of the entries in the default labels list have partially or even entirely overlapping meanings. The reason for using overlapping entries is that LLM sometimes prefers to use different labels for similar or same things. Also LLM may occasionally output slightly different labels than is present in the instruction. Fortunately this has happened relatively rarely so far. Handling of this aspect will be tuned further in the future releases of the current software. Currently unknown labels provided by LLM end up in the output field `unexpected_labels`.
* This software is different from lie detection / fact checking software. It only focuses on reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases without reliance on external knowledge bases (except for the use of a language model).


## Additional features

* The software applies input text anonymisation. Person names, organisation names, place names, etc are replaced with abstract names like Person A, Person B, etc. Also some numeric amounts are replaced. This has two purposes:
    * Anonymised input may make the LLM evaluations more fair.
    * Anonymised input significantly reduces the risk of private or sensitive data leakage.


## Example output

Biases and fallacies are currently processed separately.

### Additional remarks

In addition to labelled highlights on the field `expressions` there is a summary statistics with total counts of reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases for data analysis purposes on the field `counts`. Also a qualitative summary text is provided on the field `qualitative_evaluation`.


## Usage

Windows setup:
<br>`set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>`
<br>Linux setup:
<br>`export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>`

Main command:
<br>`python Recogniser.py "input_file.txt" "output_file.json" "list_of_labels.txt" "ignored_labels.txt"`

The user provided files are expected to be in the same folder as the main Python script, unless an absolute path is provided. If run without arguments then sample files in the `data` folder are used. If the user provides input file name but no output file name then the output JSON file name will be calculated as `input filename` + `_evaluation.json` and the output HTML and PDF file names will be calculated as `input filename` + `_evaluation.html` and `input filename` + `_evaluation.pdf`.

For example, for using built-in input texts and labels, you can use the following commands:
* `python Recogniser.py data\biases_test_input.txt data\biases_test_input_evaluation.json data\biases_labels.txt data\biases_ignored_labels.txt`
* `python Recogniser.py data\fallacies_test_input.txt data\fallacies_test_input_evaluation.json data\fallacies_labels.txt data\fallacies_ignored_labels.txt`



## Input format example

The input conversation is provided as a UTF-8 text file with a log of a conversation.

	Person A: Their message.

	Person B: Response text.

	Person A: More messages. And more sentences in that message.

	Person B: The input continues as long as the conversation to be analysed.

	Etc...


The optional input list of reasoning fallacies OR cognitive biases labels to detect is provided as a UTF-8 text file. The reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases labels lists are stored in separate files and the algorithm can process one labels list per execution. The labels are separated by newlines. The `data` folder contains a list of default labels in the following files:
* <a href="https://github.com/levitation-opensource/Critical-Thinking-Annotator/blob/main/data/biases_labels.txt"><u>biases_labels.txt</u></a> 
* <a href="https://github.com/levitation-opensource/Critical-Thinking-Annotator/blob/main/data/fallacies_labels.txt"><u>fallacies_labels.txt</u></a>

Currently the fallacies_labels.txt file is used when a user does not supply their own list of labels. The list format example follows.

    - False dilemma
    - Availability heuristic
    - Exaggeration
    Etc...

See <a href="https://github.com/levitation-opensource/Critical-Thinking-Annotator/blob/main/data/biases_labels.txt"><u>biases_labels.txt</u></a> and <a href="https://github.com/levitation-opensource/Critical-Thinking-Annotator/blob/main/data/fallacies_labels.txt"><u>fallacies_labels.txt</u></a> for the complete lists of built-in labels.


## Output format example

The software produces output in four formats:
* HTML, which contains rendering of the conversation with highlighted relevants parts and their labels. 
* The HTML includes an SVG diagram with a summary of the detected labels per person.
* PDF version of the above HTML. For setting up PDF rendering support, see <a href="https://github.com/levitation-opensource/Critical-Thinking-Annotator/blob/main/install_steps.txt"><u>install_steps.txt</u></a>. See <a href="#example-output"><u>Example output</u></a> section in this document for links to examples.
* JSON, which contains the following structure. The numbers after labels in ```expressions``` dictionaries indicate confidence level in percent. The confidence level is computed by sampling LLM labelling output multiple times according to ```SampleCount``` parameter in configuration file. Low confidence labels are automatically removed correspondingly to ```DefaultLabelThresholdSamplePercent``` parameter.

## Future plans

### Data improvements:
* Creating a list of conversation data sources / databases. Possible sources:
    * Quora
    * Reddit
    * Potential data source recommendations from Esben Kran:
        * https://talkbank.org/
        * https://childes.talkbank.org/
        * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1boRn_hpVfaXBydc3C18PTsJVutOIsM3dF3sJyFjq-vc/edit 
* Create a gold standard set of conversations and messages potentially containing reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases.
* Create a gold standard set of evaluations for a set of prompts. This can be done by collecting labelings from expert human evaluators.

### New functionalities:
* Support for single-message labelling. Currently the algorithm expects a conversation as input, but with trivial modifications it could be also applied to single messages or articles given that they have sufficient length.
* Returning logit scores over the conversation for each person and label. Example:

    ```
    "logits_summary": {
        "Person A": {
            "False dilemma": 0.9,
            "Availability heuristic": 0.7,
            "Exaggeration": 0.2
        }
    }
    ```
* Handling of similar labels with overlapping semantic themes. One reason I need that handling is because GPT does not always produce the labels as requested, but may slightly modify them. Also some labels may have naturally partially overlapping meaning, while still retaining also partial differences in meaning. This task may mean computing correlations between raw labels and rotating / computing independent traits from the raw labels.
* Add support for open-source models available at HuggingFace.


### Software tuning:
* Improving error handling.
* Invalid LLM output detection. Sometimes LLM produces results in a different format than expected.

### New related apps:
* Building and setting up a web based API endpoint.
* Building and setting up a web based user interface for non-programmer end users.
* Publishing a Slack plugin.

### Experiments:
* Test reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases detection against various known prompt injection prompts.
* Test reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases detection against general prompt databases (for example, AutoGPT database).
* Benchmark various known LLM-s:
    * LLM resistance to reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases from users. Even if the user input contains reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases, the LLM output should not contain reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases.
    * Measure presence of reasoning fallacies and cognitive biases in LLM outputs in case of benign user inputs.
