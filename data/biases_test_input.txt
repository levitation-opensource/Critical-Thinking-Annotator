# Here are descriptions of number of situations illustrating cognitive biases. Can you recognise and name what cognitive biases are involved in each situation?


# Confirmation Bias:
Person X: Imagine a person who strongly believes that a particular diet is effective for weight loss. They may seek out information that supports this belief, such as success stories or positive reviews, while ignoring or dismissing information that contradicts it.

# Sunk Cost Fallacy:
Person X: Consider a business that has invested a significant amount of money in a project. Even if the project is proving to be unprofitable or unsustainable, the decision-makers might continue to invest more resources because of the emotional and financial investment already made, rather than objectively evaluating the project's current and future prospects.

# Anchoring Bias:
Person X: In negotiations, the first offer or piece of information often acts as an anchor that influences subsequent decisions. If you're selling a car and you start with a high asking price, even if it's negotiable, potential buyers may be anchored to that higher figure when making counteroffers.

# Availability Heuristic:
Person X: People tend to give more weight to information that is readily available to them. For instance, if someone hears about a recent plane crash, they may become more fearful of flying, even though statistically, flying is a very safe mode of transportation.

# Hindsight Bias:
Person X: After a stock market crash, some investors might claim that they "knew all along" that it was going to happen. This bias involves the tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that one would have predicted or expected the outcome.

# Overconfidence Bias:
Person X: A student might be overly confident about acing an exam and not study adequately. This bias can lead individuals to overestimate their own abilities or the accuracy of their beliefs.

# Groupthink:
Person X: In a corporate setting, if a team is overly cohesive and values harmony over critical evaluation, they may not thoroughly analyze potential risks or alternative strategies, leading to suboptimal decision-making.

# Loss Aversion:
Person X: Investors might be more likely to sell winning stocks to "lock in" gains but hold on to losing stocks in the hope that they will rebound. This behavior is driven by the desire to avoid the emotional pain of realizing a loss.

# Self-Serving Bias:
Person X: In the workplace, an individual who receives positive feedback on a successful project might attribute the success to their own skills and leadership. However, if the project fails, they might blame external factors beyond their control.
