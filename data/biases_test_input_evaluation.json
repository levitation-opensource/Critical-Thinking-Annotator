  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person X is discussing various cognitive biases and fallacies that can affect decision-making. These include confirmation bias (favoring information that confirms pre-existing beliefs), sunk cost fallacy (continuing a behavior due to previously invested resources), anchoring bias (relying too heavily on an initial piece of information), availability heuristic (relying on immediate examples that come to mind), hindsight bias (believing one could have predicted an event after it has occurred), overconfidence bias (overestimating one's abilities or knowledge), groupthink (prioritizing harmony over critical evaluation), loss aversion (preferring to avoid losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains), and self-serving bias (attributing success to oneself and failures to external factors)."
