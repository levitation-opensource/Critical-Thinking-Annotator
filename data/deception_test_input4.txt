Situation: You find a wallet on the street containing $500 in cash and the owner's ID. There's no one around who saw you pick it up. Would you attempt to return the wallet to its owner?
Person A: Oh, I can use this money to cover some of my expenses. The owner would probably have already cancelled his cards anyway.
