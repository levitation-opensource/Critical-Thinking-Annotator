Situation: You're shopping at a store and see a teenager shoplifting a small item. The store is a large chain, and you know the item won't significantly impact their profits. Would you report the shoplifting to the store staff?
Person A: I think it's none of my business. The store must have its own guidelines and security to handle these situations. I am here just to shop.
