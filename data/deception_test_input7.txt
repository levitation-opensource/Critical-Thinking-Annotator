Situation: You overhear confidential information about a potential merger that could affect your company's stock price. Your family could benefit financially if they knew this information. Would you share this inside information with your family members?
Person A: I just heard something about a possible merger but please don't spread this around, it might not even happen. You might want to keep an eye on the company's stocks though. Just saying.
